# ASTI App Accessibility Audit Report

## 1. Overview of Existing Accessibility Features

The ASTI app has implemented several accessibility features for neurodivergent users, focusing on ADHD, autism, and anxiety support. This audit provides an overview of existing features, identifies areas for improvement, and recommends actions to enhance the accessibility of the application.

## 2. Existing Features

### 2.1. ARIA Attributes and Roles
- **Extensive use of ARIA roles**: The application uses appropriate roles such as `role="status"`, `role="alert"`, `role="button"`, `role="complementary"`, and `role="region"` to provide semantic meaning to components.
- **ARIA labels**: Components have descriptive `aria-label` attributes, including stress level indicators, form controls, and interactive elements.
- **ARIA relationships**: Proper use of `aria-labelledby` and `aria-describedby` to create relationships between elements.

### 2.2. Accessibility Context and Preferences
- **AccessibilityContext**: A dedicated context provides accessibility preferences across the application.
- **Preference options include**:
  - High contrast mode
  - Reduced motion
  - Text scaling and font size control
  - Line spacing adjustments
  - Focus mode
  - Sound effects controls
  - Color scheme options (light, dark, system)
  - Colorblind mode

### 2.3. Stress Management Features
- **Stress sensitivity controls**: Users can adjust how the app identifies potentially stressful content
- **Cognitive load reduction**: Features to simplify complex emails
- **Break reminders**: Configurable reminders during high-stress periods
- **Task breakdown assistance**: AI-powered assistance to break down complex tasks

### 2.4. Focus Management
- **FocusAssistant component**: Helps users navigate through focused elements
- **Focus mode**: Allows users to concentrate on specific content
- **Focus time management**: Implements timed focus sessions with breaks

### 2.5. Testing Infrastructure
- **Jest-axe**: Automated accessibility testing using axe-core
- **Custom neurodivergent-specific tests**: Additional checks for color contrast, focus order, animations, and text spacing
- **Test helpers**: Specialized testing utilities for accessibility validation

## 3. Areas for Improvement

### 3.1. Active Functionality
- **Inconsistent implementation**: Some components may not fully utilize ARIA roles and attributes
- **Keyboard navigation**: Some interactive elements may not be fully keyboard accessible
- **Focus states**: Focus indicators may not be consistently visible across the application

### 3.2. Real-time Settings
- **Settings application**: Changes to settings should apply immediately without requiring page refresh
- **Preview functionality**: Users should be able to preview accessibility changes before applying them

### 3.3. Testing
- **Automated test coverage**: Not all components have comprehensive accessibility tests
- **End-to-end testing**: Need for broader testing scenarios covering common user flows

### 3.4. Documentation
- **Accessibility documentation**: Limited documentation on accessibility features and how to use them
- **Developer guidelines**: Missing guidelines for maintaining accessibility in new components

## 4. Recommendations

### 4.1. Short-term Actions
1. **Audit and fix ARIA attributes**: Ensure all interactive elements have appropriate ARIA roles, states, and properties
2. **Enhance keyboard navigation**: Verify that all interactive elements can be accessed and operated via keyboard
3. **Improve focus states**: Make focus indicators more visible and consistent across the application
4. **Add automated accessibility tests**: Implement tests for all components using jest-axe

### 4.2. Medium-term Actions
1. **Implement real-time settings preview**: Allow users to see effects of accessibility changes before applying
2. **Expand test coverage**: Add more comprehensive tests including specific neurodivergent user scenarios
3. **Create accessibility documentation**: Document all accessibility features and how to use them
4. **Add developer guidelines**: Create guidelines for maintaining accessibility in new components

### 4.3. Long-term Actions
1. **User testing with neurodivergent users**: Conduct usability tests with target audience
2. **Advanced customization options**: Allow more granular control of accessibility features
3. **AI-powered accessibility suggestions**: Implement smart suggestions for accessibility settings based on user behavior

## 5. Next Steps

1. Complete implementation of all existing accessibility features
2. Create automated tests to verify functionality
3. Update documentation with clear instructions for users
4. Establish ongoing accessibility monitoring and review process
