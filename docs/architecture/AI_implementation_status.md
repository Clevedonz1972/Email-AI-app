   - Create schemas for entities (people, projects, tasks)
   - Implement graph query interface
   - Integrate with AI prompts

2. **Memory Management UI**
   - Create interface for users to view their memory store
   - Allow editing and deletion of memories
   - Implement memory categories and tagging

3. **Backend Integration**
   - Move from client-side to server-side storage
   - Implement user-specific collections
   - Set up proper authentication and privacy controls

### Long-Term Vision (5+ weeks)

1. **Advanced Intelligence Features**
   - Proactive insights based on memory patterns
   - Personalized suggestions based on user behavior
   - Contextual awareness across different application areas

2. **Optimization and Performance**
   - Reduce API calls with better caching
   - Explore on-device embeddings for privacy and cost
   - Implement batch processing for efficiency

3. **User Experience Refinement**
   - Fine-tune interaction modes for different neurodivergent needs
   - Personalize communication styles based on user feedback
   - Implement learning mechanisms to adapt to user preferences over time

## Implementation Notes

- The current implementation uses localStorage for memory persistence to enable rapid development
- Future implementations will gradually move to server-side processing for security and scale
- We're prioritizing user control and transparency in all AI features
- Performance optimization will become more important as the memory store grows
