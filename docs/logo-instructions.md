# Neurodiversity Ltd Logo Implementation

## Current Implementation

The landing page has been updated to include the Neurodiversity Ltd logo, which is located at:
```
/public/assets/Neurodivarsity ltd logo.png
```

The logo is already in place and no additional steps are needed for basic implementation.

## Logo Usage

The logo is implemented in the Landing page component with the following code:

```tsx
<Box 
  component="img"
  src="/assets/Neurodivarsity ltd logo.png"
  alt="Neurodiversity Ltd"
  sx={{ 
    maxWidth: isMobile ? '200px' : '250px',
    height: 'auto',
    mb: 3
  }}
/>
```

## Accessibility Considerations

- The logo includes proper alt text: "Neurodiversity Ltd"
- The logo is positioned at the top of the page for immediate brand recognition
- Responsive sizing ensures visibility on all devices

## Testing

Testing considerations for the logo implementation:

1. Check the landing page in both light and dark mode
2. Verify the logo displays properly on mobile devices
3. Ensure the logo has adequate contrast against the background
4. Confirm the alt text is available to screen readers

## Potential Future Enhancements

- Consider adding a subtle animation to the logo on page load
- Implement proper preloading for the logo to prevent layout shifts
- Add srcset or picture element support for different resolutions if needed
- If needed, consider creating an SVG version for crisper rendering at all sizes
