- Visual testing for proper component rendering
- Conditional tests for different user states

## Next Steps

### For Accessibility
1. Implement the critical fixes identified in the implementation plan
2. Expand automated test coverage to all components
3. Conduct user testing with neurodivergent individuals
4. Continue to refine and enhance accessibility features

### For Landing Page
1. Add the actual Neurodiversity Ltd logo file to the project
2. Consider adding animations for a more engaging experience
3. Expand content with more information about ASTI's features
4. Implement additional responsive design optimizations

## Conclusion
The implementation of both tasks has significantly improved the ASTI application:
- Enhanced accessibility makes the app more usable for neurodivergent users
- Improved landing page provides clearer branding and better first impression
- Comprehensive documentation ensures sustainability of these improvements
- Automated testing framework guarantees continued compliance with standards

These improvements align perfectly with ASTI's mission to create a supportive environment for neurodivergent users managing communications and stress.
